# Gaalet - a C++ expression template library for implementing geometric algebra

This repository is a fork of the one at [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gaalet/).

This library has support for PGA3D (Projective Geometric Algebra, also known as
Plane-based Geometric Algebra).  

For a description of PGA, see
[A Guided Tour to the Plane-Based Geometric Algebra PGA](https://bivector.net/PGA4CS.html).
